I mean when you have so many cool objects and characters and locations and monsters... it's a pity that the whole thing is gone in 2 or 3 little comic books, isn't it?At least with this book we get to dive in some of the characters' previous life and the result is that we start caring about them.

The singing, acting, and orchestra are very good. So is the opera (one of Massenet.s most popular). But the scenery and the shift of time to the 1950s make it seem silly. As for the scenery, the giant tree that is the theme in all four acts is fine for act 1 (the garden) and act II (the town square, but is rather silly as the wall of the sitting room in act III and is totally ridiculous in Act IV where Werther's death bed in his bedroom is under this tree. Changing the time to the 1950s makes the plot unbeleavable.

My kids ripped and flung a few things in their excitement to get all set up for the new kitty, and so the charcoal filter went uninstalled for a few days. Sadly, I can honestly say I notice no difference at all in the level of odor after installing the filter. And no difference at all between the odor from this box and the small cheap-o open box we had at first.That said, I'd still buy it again for the sleek look, compact size and the nice enclosure. I wasn't really expecting it to smell good-- it's a box full of leavings, after all-- but I definitely expected it to contain the litter.

Dino Valenti was in jail and did not appear on this recording which gets it an extra half star from me.

His mission is to either take control of the vessel or sink it. With a skillful performance, he causes the viewer to really believe that he will accomplish his mission at all costs. But in the end, he is only doing his duty. As for the movie's other qualities, the computer graphics appear cartoonish at first, but they end up adding creative and helpful scenes to the storyline.

Boring, boring, boring, is the best I can say about it. Very little special effects. Mostly just on his zombie makeup. This is one movie I couldn't reccomend to anyone.\n"}, {"label": "negative", "sentence": "Title: Skip it\nText: I rarely encounter books that are so overblown it feels like running up-hill trying to get through them, but this book certainly made me feel this way.

It is as sharp, intelligent and bitingly funny as he is (or isn't). It also manages to capture the complex human being who is Wally George. Is he really a master performance artists who lowers himself to the level of his audience? Or is he the borderline retard who doesn't know anything about politics or humor? You decide. All I can tell you is that watching Wally's show on Saturday nights is a bit like taking mushrooms: nothing makes sense. (For the really bold, try doing them both at the same time; it will scar you forever). Anyway, this book sucks just like Wally does.

There are plenty of moments which you'd rather not be sharing with the troubled characters, but the film compels you to watch.The film medium perhaps suits Ball's subject matter better than TV.

The new moves are the same, but there is less of the boxing emphasis I love. The best part about Tae Bo is kicking and punching and I feel like in an attempt to include the amplifier bar they left that by the way-side a bit.It is a great fat burner and will get your heart rate up, but if you were a fan of the old Tae Bo you may be a bit disappointed. Billy also loses track of time in the first dvd (Fat Burn Accelerator) and abruptly announces the workout portion is over.

I am probably more sceptical of recent Disney releases than most of my cohorts, so this movie had to earn 4 stars from me. It is entertaining, a film parents can trust to allow children of all ages watch, and is equally entertaining for adults. I would by no means put it on par with some of the Disney classics. However, that being said this is by far one of the best films Disney has done in the past 20 years. This film has the feel of one of the classic Disney films prior to the 1980's. A thoroughly enjoyable movie for all ages (I can't say that for all of Disney's recent releases).My version of this movie comes with two short films. One is the history of the rat, which is actually very educational and informative. The other short is moderately entertaining but nothing I feel deserves more than a passing comment.\n"}, {"label": "negative", "sentence": "Title: Not worth it\nText: I bought this as a Black Friday special to replace a Linksys Wireless B router.

The CD walks any user through the process, regardless of that individual's IT expierience.-The signal is very strong; I can connect to this router with full strength from anywhere within my apartment (approximatley 800 sq. feet).Cons:-Singal constantly drops or locks up. I am often surfing and my laptop will disconnect; when I try to reconnect I am unable to do so. The router has to be restarted and for those of you who have done it you know it is a time-consuming process. The router, cable modem, and both computers have to be restarting. Takes all of 10 minutes.To me it just wasn't worth it. I am using my linksys router again and will probably do so until I NEED to replace it.

The graphics and controls are decent, meaning that you can generally distinguish targets and terrain and the movement isn't difficult to master. The fundamentals of the game are sound in that the solo missions are satisfying, the campaigns follow the same theme as the solo's, but it's the multiplayer that is the biggest let down. Unfortunately there are cheat codes that find their way into the multi-play. So, for example, if you are playing flagball and someone is using speed-cheat, forget it, the game is over.

To be honest, when you interview members of the United House of Prayer for All People you get a one sided view, filled with legends about Bishop Grace.

Maybe this should have been obvious from the price, but I was still very disappointed that I spent $50 on something that was more appropriately made to be a play tool kit for a child than to be used to actually do any kind of repairs.

The point of view broadens as Elizabeth develops as a character and loses her prejudices, particularly against Mr. Darcy.Pride and Prejudice continues to be extremely popular and inspires many spin-offs including Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.

It has apparently been edited substantially from its original Latin form, leaving out all the salacious bits for the prudent Western audience.It contains wondrous descriptions of the magical properties of stones, plants, and animals. Most of these descriptions are incomplete, or at least don't actually describe what their headings advertise.

Of course one shouldn't get too deep into psychological aspects of the story (Peter Pan the boy that didn't want to grow up) or analyze sexual stereotypes (Wendy is automatically the \"mommy\" that will read stories, but never defends herself or others against Hook and his crew).

I found it too talky and its plot was not believable. It was really hard for me to suspend my disbelief while watching it. None of the characters were endearing and it was a challenge to care about what happened to them. Also, in real life, there would be no chemistry between Downey's character and the female lead, Ms. Monaghan. Her history and the reprehensible manner in which she treats him would preclude his devotion (unless he was a complete masochist). Further, and to my disappointment as I'm an extremely politically incorrect person, I found all the gay jokes about Kilmer's Perry obtuse. I really don't think anyone cares about that stuff much in this day and age. Overall, the interactions are too clever by half, and Downey's narration is a bore.

The actors are terrific and the plot is terrific. Dickens sympathized with people in humble vocations and here the movie manages to cause one to feel for the signalman who is haunted by a specter. The specter portends two horrible events, and on the third occasion portends the death of the signalman himself. It wasn't out of morbid sentiment that Dickens made this his ending, but it serves his heartfelt sentiment for those kind souls who were born into misfortune, were caste into misfortune by evil personages, or, like here, who squandered it through some series of hapless bad choices.

Much focus is placed on the shenanigans of the Clinton White House, which almost seems to be an issue done to death. Vincent and McCain do bring up several Republican wrong-doers to be fair. I think the writers' strongest point is that while Republicans seem to face up to their crimes or at least have to pay the penalty, Democrats very often do not and are occasionally rewarded for them.

Basically, it's too flat to cater to those who enjoy poetic or \"flowery\" writing, any messages Tolstoy manages to put across seem obvious and clichéd, and the characters have even less depth than the story. Furthermore, Tolstoy's apparent feeling about the nature of humanity is bleaker than Poe's.

Curious friends are murdered. In the end, it is up to Susie to challenge and destroy the evil overshadowing the tall, imposing school of dance.The directing is first rate.

He originally went to India with a documentary film team. He became so enthralled with the chanting he encountered there that he ended up staying and studying there, immersing himself in the culture and the language.Some of the songs (e.g., \"I and Me\")on Brink seem to bring an American sensibility to the concept of chanting. This could confuse or annoy purists, but one of the things about Stringer that appeals to me is his ability to convey the universal aspects of chants.It's hard for me to imagine what this album would sound like to someone who has not seen Dave's passion in action, but it is both deep and light-hearted, an important contribution to the chanting genre.\n"}, {"label": "very negative", "sentence": "Title: No Man is an Island???\nText: That this book comes from the same pen as the charming and throughly enjoyable series starring Pat and the Gang is amazing...I found Shutter Island to be pretentious, boring, confusing; there were few, if any redeeming qualities.

Having said that, I did find myself turning each page in dread at the thought of something horrible happening. So on the whole a harmless pageturner. Hasn't turned me into an Amy Tan Fan or Hater.

The medical descriptions and dialog are real as they can get without bogging down to much in the details and the character development is excellent. The plot is a bit contrived but still believable. Having a notorious criminal getting an operation to change his appearance is one thing, but to have a known world terrorist operated on for a brain tumor and the lengths he goes to have the delicate surgery was a fresh take on the subject. I could easily see this being made into a movie as it moved along at a good clip, kept you guessing along the way and had a character you'd love to hate (the chief of surgery). The book has several subplots which kept your interest throughout and moved the story along. All in alll a very good read.

The more serious and recent problems are that the basket seems to be seriously clogged, despite lemon juice or vinegar cleaning treatments and maybe because or in addition to this, the seal around the basket leaks and the steam setting leaks, sending some seriously hot gasses through the grinds and diluting your just made cup of espresso if you haven't removed it.

Thomas pulls us into her life and her mind as we venture through all the changes with her. The book is written so conversationally that the reader can't help but feel as if the author is a close friend and one we care strongly about. While there are struggles and sadness in the book, the tone doesn't become heavy or depressing. Thomas manages to keep it upbeat so that we're not bogged down by the events. As she learns to live again, we are right there with her and learn much about our own thoughts and feelings. What would we do if our lives were twisted in a way such as her's was? Would we come through it as strongly as she? These are questions that flicker through the mind and it gives one pause to wonder. This is an all around great book and a quick read.

A large Group of people used to gather almost everyday to sit around and just drink. People in the story were always concerned about their self.

I thought Jake, the main character and the narrator, shouldn't have had to go through what he went through; .He didn't deserve all that. Jake was an innocent man who just wanted on thing, and that was Brett.This novel is very similar to modern day times. Sometimes people engage in drinking just to get away from their everyday struggles.. The time in which this novel took place and now times are similar in ways. In both the characters in the novel and people now-a-days, turn to alcohol for relief and have tendencies to party all night long.

The cards are layed out and you start rolling the dice to win \"prizes.\" Even though you win one, it can be won from you by another player if they roll what is needed. The winner is the one with three prizes at the BEGINNING of their turn. This makes for a lot of passing and rooting for someone else. I like that.The only real draw-back to the game is that so many prizes are almost impossible to get and usually the same ones get tried for over and over again. This can make for a longer game than necessary. And, if you're playing with people who are not risk takers, the game gets a little slow and predictable.The low educational rating is due to the fact that the game doesn't require that player to do anything but count and remember.Overall, this is a great little game to buy for the whole family.

As many have pointed out, the first chapter (actually a 27 page paragraph) makes the author analyze a room of Polish people and, without knowing the language or actually hearing conversations in toto, assign them roles as if casting the play that follows. I think this is why we are left with incompletely fleshed out characters. The premise of the book ( expatriation from European nobility to American homgenation) has been written before and better. There are pages of beautiful descriptive writing to be sure - Sontag is well practiced at her craft - but in the end we are left not really caring about the stolid, laborious venture through which we've waded. Though Sontag is hypnotized by studies of history's influences on the present, I think she writes better when she sticks to her own metier.\n"}, {"label": "neutral", "sentence": "Title: A bit odd\nText: This is a very odd and confusing movie.

Perhaps Toby Keith should have allowed himself MUCH more time to write a CD with substance after the release of \"Unleashed\". I'm pretty disappointed with the album, and pretty angry that ~$15.00 was wasted on it.As an aside, I find it pretty pathetic that artists are using the 9/11 attacks as a way to make their albums sell.

Another plus are the featurettes, one on Gene Kelly which is well done and another on the making of this particular film. Both are very interesting. The only disappointment is the 1:33:1 format - or a standard format. This is a film which should have been done in widescreen - especially the dance sequence at the end.

Hank Junior, who was a step away from grandmasterdom in his true love, chess, got drunk in an Icelandic pub the night before a match and started to ad lib an old Viking sea ditty with Thor Magnusson, a local musician. Bobby Fischer walked in, heard Hank's heart-rending sounds, and said, \"son, as brilliant a chess prodigy as you are, it's nigh time you put your board away and pick up your gee-tar.\" Hank took Fishpincher's advice and took off with it, running.

The second ''|\\'' key exists for no reason (I guess that the manufacturer did not want to make another irregular size ''Alt'' or ''Start'' key ) and it kind of interferes, sitting between the ''SpaceBar'' and the left ''Alt''.

For the Queen album in question, a medley extends through songs three (\"Tenement Funster\"), four (\"Flick of the Wrist\"), and five (\"Lily of the Valley\") for a total of 8 minutes and 17 seconds. The medley starts to ring in my head as soon as I think of it: heavy power cords, dramatic changes in tone from soft to heavy, from serious to flamboyant. The medley is followed by \"Now I'm Here,\" which has more fun dramatic changes. I once heard Queen referred to as a heavy metal band, and track 8 (\"Stone Cold Crazy\") could attest to that. Most people, however, would probably argue against such a label; but man, does Queen love its head-banging moments!\n"}, {"label": "very negative", "sentence": "Title: Old Tech\nText: Im 75 and let me tell you about this productpros-- was new in a box and arrived very quickly in good conditioncons--This computer case is at least 10 years old and not very suited for todays computer needs, it comes not suited to todays sata needs ---the power supply is not sata power equiped.I was building a new computer so i had to get a new power supply in order to use this case so the cost was increased another 45$, a few days The Geeks offered to return my money if i returned it.This was a no option for me as the computer was already built,I told them they could send me another power supply of 420 watts that was sata ready but I havent heard back from them.My opinion old new computer equipment shold be labeled as such,I wonder how many others have been suckered this waythe total buying experience was not a good one\n"}, {"label": "neutral", "sentence": "Title: Very good, but prepare for some frustration.\nText: If you have enjoyed realistic fighting games in the vein of Bushido Blade, you will enjoy the ultra-realistic version of the UFC. Much like Bushido Blade, matches play out more like a game of chess than a music video, and this is very good. Frustration enters when you attempt to fight the computer armed with very little idea of how to do anything. For such a deep game, the manual is woefully inadequate. You basically have to learn how to counter moves and switch grappling positions by trial and error. The end result is that your submission moves are usually unsuccessful while the computer's holds almost always put the hurt on you. If you can afford to spend enough time to figure the game out, I'm sure it's immensely rewarding, and for $10 here on amazon.com it's probably worth a shot. I would recommend heading over to ign.com and taking a look at the game guide to get a better idea of what you're getting into first, though. Break a leg.

Once the \"REGEX\" portion was applied against the \"TEXT\", wasn't the \"RESULT\" portion supposed to show only what was filtered? This made the examples meaningless for me.

She brings to life the art of weaving tapestries, the woad dyer,(and his smell of sheep's urine,) with color and vitality. We see the importance of the Guilds, and the Church in the daily lives of the people. Arranged marriages, and a stay in a convent all help to support the way it really was. Chevalier brings the characters to life, and adds the sights, smells, sounds, and feelings of the period.It will almost make you believe in the healing powers of the Unicorn.

It is enough to say that I have also read (like many others) all the books in this series. In my opinion the storylines are getting dry and dull. Unlike some other reviewers, I am not disturbed by the religious subtext. After all, the main characters in this series are Orthodox Jews. Obviously there will be references to the importance religion plays in their lives. The plot started out interesting but soon turned boring. I forced myself to finish the book. The interaction between Rina, Peter and their children are becoming far more interesting than the storylines.

So many games have gotten camera control right, it's a shame this one didn't.The biggest plus over NWN I is that you can finally have a full party again. That's what made games like Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale so much fun, and that fun is now back again. If your system meets the requirements for this game, you'll have a lot of fun.

Musically it lies somewhere between AoB and Bruce's earlier work, \"Ball to Picasso.\" The album starts out fairly heavy and then becomes more varied and emotive towards the end.

In one lengthy passage, the author uses old and new James analysis to make a case for Lou Whitaker being severly underrated and having had more value to his teams than Ernie Banks or Lou Brock to theirs. Whether you agree or disagree, or you like Bill James or don't, this book is pretty fascinating. Some reviewers have complained about the structure, but I found it a fun and easy read.

Artists like conguero Francisco Aguabella, one of Cuba's greats; Papo Vazquez, who fuses Afro-Caribbean rhythms with his sensatational trombone playing; Bobby Matos, a leading figure in Latin Jazz; John Santos, a master of percussion; and London's Snowboy, who popularized the music in Europe.

The mother and four sisters are almost completely selfish and self-motivated, often at the expense of their children or siblings, although one sister is perhaps a little better than the rest. This is not my favorite work by Ruth Rendell writing as Barbara Vine but I think it is one of the most memorable.

The dubbed-in operatic baritone by an Italian actor playing a Frenchman with an Italian accent both when he speaks and when he sings (?) sounds ludicrous to the 21st-century ear, the dialogue is frequently laughable, and the bizarre directorial decision to film some scenes through color filters that just look nasty, combine to make this an exceptionally overrated piece of nostalgic cheese. Plenty of ham to go with it, too. Bleah. The only reason there's more than one star in my rating is that the film does very well in making its point against racism, a socially redeeming factor that was very much germaine in the late '50s.

A great, wholesome read~\n"}, {"label": "positive", "sentence": "Title: pretty good\nText: I really liked the beginning of the book when they didn't know who the other was and also the way they found out they were betrothed.

An expertise in the pure computational algorithms is not enough.Given the ongoing advances in computing hardware, some aspects of the book are undoubtedly already slightly behind the times.

Making such a big deal (book) out of so small a chapter seemed somewhat lame, to me.Overall, Queen Sayoko is both funny and charming, with the slightest hint of romance. Thus, it gets 4 stars, but loses out on the 5th one because it lacked the comedy-romance-charming ratio I'd expect from such a series.\n"}, {"label": "negative", "sentence": "Title: John Irving, where are you?\nText: Mr. Irving in response to this rendering of this novel, said they only got about 1/8th of the story he wrote.

Even under the worst of conditions where you can't decide, it's still somewhat handy, since flipping breakers one a time until the tone stops still beats flipping a breaker and jogging to some other part of the house to see if you got the right one.\n"}, {"label": "neutral", "sentence": "Title: HIT AND MISS MENAGERiE\nText: Writers like to write, some profusely, others pithily.

The mixing is a little dense, and the band is let down by a rather lugubrious drummer.

I really like both of the actors in this movie. And to describe some of the scenes to my friends, you would think it was a hilarious movie. So I'm pretty sure the writing was good, but the execution was off. The timing and the passion never seemed to click. Maybe having Downey Jr. as the straight guy was the problem. He seemed more mean that funny. Mean can be funny if given proper attention - Dr. Evil is quite funny, but he was vulnerable too. Downey's vulnerable side seemed fake so you never really cared about the character. Comedy is surely one of the hardest forms of acting to capture on film - you really have to commit to the character and the scene. This movie and the actors never really did that. There were a few funny moments, but in all it was a rather dull ride. What a shame. I really wanted to like this movie. Two popular actors cashing a check.

They responded the next day advising me to call Electra Craft Inc, a service center, at 201-439-1700. When I called Electra, they informed me that the repair would most likely run around $100 plus shipping both ways. Well, I'd wind up paying close to the cost of the entire machine at that rate.

The preview made it look like a father-son film about being a better father and better man. For every step forward Cage takes, he takes at least two backwards.The sad part is through all of this conflict, there was a tremendous potential for the character to grow, but that never happens.

The vampires are way more in line with my personal preferences on how they would behave; rather than trying to sexually seduce or hypnotize a victim, they just tear them apart.

Jack Johnson is an analytical songwriter - he knows what is essential and sticks to it. He conveys a lot with what, on the surface, appears very little.

I put some in a liquid soap 'foaming' bottle with some jojoba oil for conditioning & I use that for shampoo. You can google recipes for homemade shampoo using castille soap. You can also use melted coconut butter or flax oil to condition your hair (sounds silly, but it works great!)

As a result, we find its easy to gain weight and difficult to lose it.The people who appear in the film are likeable, and one sympathizes with their earnest attempts to \"do the right thing.\" But the viewer sees little reason to hope that their lives will improve. The filmmakers imply that it is just too difficult to control weight in our calorie-rich, sedentary world.

Songwriter and guitarist Patrick Linton has soft vocals that are engaging as on \"Yellow Dusk,\" \"And though it seems that I am older, a thing I never wanted to be, and suddenly the world is golden, there is nothing left out there for me.\" \"Where I'm Going\" is a piano based road song like a pastiche of images, \"And I look into those eyes, we got such a long way to go.\" While not every track works equally well, the CD maintains interest because Linton has unique musical ideas and keeps trying different things.

Female readers will sure enjoy this novel better than most male counterparts. Typical to most lady writers, details are presently vivid on the characters and actions they did.If you are looking for a Da Vinci Code-like thriller in this book, you might as well forget about it. I almost abandoned this book after 100+ pages of nothing. But I strived to finish it, since Miss Mosse is one of the Orange Award on literatures, and she must have some \"muscle\" at the end. It did have some muscle.

There are plenty of good jokes (like the out of focus actor, played surprisingly subtly by Robin Williams) and set pieces.

The previous inspirational lyrics (\"Refugee\" and \"Even The Losers\" from DAMN THE TORPEDOES and \"I Won't Back Down\" from FULL MOON FEVER are wondrous examples) have, sadly, been replaced by mean-spirited hopelessness that cannot be mitigated by his advocacy of sanctions against Indonesia in the wake of that country's trumped-up drug-smuggling conviction against a young Australian tourist.

I gave this two stars rather than one because for a reader new to the period the book at least encapsulates the basic facts and trends.

Pratchett, as always, is brilliantly funny and biting with his satire. No target is safe. As the title of the book implies, Pratchett's motto seems to be \"carpe jugulum... go for the throat.\"I must admit, as far as the series-within-a-series Discworld books go, it took time for me to warm up to Granny Weatherwax.

There is also the possibility that she, as a writer, has edited her version of the past as a protection for someone or atonement for something.That said, this is not your standard Barnard mystery, with deliciously nasty characters and a real puzzler that only resolves in the last few lines.

My point is that I want to hear the vocal nuances of this talented singer, but cannot make them out.

There is very little biographical information available about Ayyash, so Katz makes do with what he has.I agree with another review who was concerned with Katz's overly vivid descriptions of events and scenes he didn't witness.

Eddings takes a word (for example, \"blandly\") or a conversation style (\"I liked that\" \"I thought you might\") and uses them repeatedly. The story itself has an interesting premise.

The story is fascinating, and, if one needs a brief look at the (mainly) military side of events early in the war, this book can be useful. Beginning about mid-way through 1775, the story works through its title year and early 1777, providing a clear picture of the difficulties Washington and his Continental soldiers experienced. However, most of the research comes from published sources, with a couple of notable exceptions, and some battles, for example, White Plains, are glossed over so quickly one best not blink. There is nothing new here, but, for someone beginning a study of the Revolution, this might be a nice place to learn some basics.

Instead of telling an adventurous quest filled with exciting action, this novel was confusing at times for many different themes were introduced at inappropriate times in the novel. Even the format of this book was confusing. This novel was split into two parts, a tale of a man and a tale of a woman. I give the author some credit for writing a novel vividly, painting imaginations into the reader's head. However, I disliked the way that he failed to connect the 'two' stories together.

Also, the pianist that accompanies them has a deft way of supporting the vocals without overwhelming them or becoming underwhelming himself. It's a balancing act of pure magic. The Hannibal CD has superb sound quality (considering the age of these recordings)--it really sparkles--and great selections. This is music you can listen to when you're happy, when you're sad, when you want to do a little two-step for the heck of it, when you want to think. It's versatile. It's perfect.

The seals are really finicky and I'm always scared the bags are going to bust open in my pump bag on the way home from work. I've also had issues with the holes for the attachment \"hooks\" ripping. Add in the limited space for milk (5 oz as opposed to Lansinoh's 6oz bags with room to spare) and the milk that gets above the zipper seal while you're pumping (even with a Pump In Style), and these are just a bad product.

The seat is extra-wide to accommodate me, and I can even fold it up and put it in the trunk of the car. The BIG downside to this walker is that the overall height (the wheelbase to the seat) is NOT adjustable, only the handles. When I need to sit I must put on the breaks and then tiptoe up to shimmy onto the seat. Then, when I sit fully on the seat my both feet swing freely, I'm 5'5\" tall. Since this is extra-wide, I have found that it does not go through a few of the doors in my house. I would heartily recommend it to tall plus-size persons and you might want to check the opening measurement of your doors.\n"}, {"label": "positive", "sentence": "Title: It will open your hearts and eyes\nText: I feel like my eyes were opened for the first time.

But if you're looking for something insightful, watch \"Proust in Love\" or something.\n"}, {"label": "very positive", "sentence": "Title: best wu mid 90s solo for real\nText: i really think this was the best wu solo, raes was more lyrycal with beter beats but this cut was too funny man it was madd\n"}, {"label": "neutral", "sentence": "Title: Interesting in a Subtle Way\nText: Author's reflections on ways that Americans could enrich their lives by appreciating and cultivating domestic delights.

With a cast of unknowns or up-and-comers, it would shine as a fun little indie film. But with the comedic talents of Martin, Shandling, Kahn, Sanders, and others, you can't help but wonder why the movie isn't funnier. All complaints aside, it is a good film, as there are countless laughs throughout. But these moments are mostly due to the excellent performances by all (with Liev Schreiber stealing the show in what could have been a very cliche role), rather than the script itself, which seems to be uncomfortable with being a dark comedy, and continuously attempts to redeem itself with sappy couplings and a typical Kapra-esque happy ending. It may not make your list of Holiday Must-See films, but if you aren't expecting a miracle, you should come away happy.\n"}, {"label": "neutral", "sentence": "Title: Aun no se pues no he recibido el producto\nText: Estoy esperando que me envien el IMac 5 desde USA, pero mi cunado lo tiene y el esta fascinado, muero por ponerle mismanos a esa Apple\n"}, {"label": "very negative", "sentence": "Title: Lame\nText: I needed a book to help me quickly find methods for specific tasks in Excel.

Barrett does a great job of introducing and finishing the story with his pre and post notes that hint as if Rowley was a real person and theses are real memoirs. I don't rate this higher because I had trouble identifying Rowley as a character. Rowley doesn't give the impression that he's fallen \"in love\" with his captor (though he no doubt believes that he has), but rather he's been brainwashed by her. His actions and attitude indicate psychological injury not unlike a Patty Hearst Syndrome, and the reader ends up feeling a pathetic pity towards Rowley. Again, the best parts of the book are Barrett's own narratives, which entice you to research these Taiping warriors and learn more about this period of Chinese history.

There are some big lagoons between the really good parts and they don't allow the book to reach a crescendo. However the book is *not* boring at all it does takes the story a step further and Clarke's imagination and his point of view on the cosmos continues to be really interesting.

Unfortunately, I do not live near a retail store that sells Molton Brown products so I did not have the opportunity to smell the sample before purchasing it. I bought Naran Ji Fine solely based on the overwhelming high reviews from various websites and for it being their number one seller.

I probably would have liked the story better if I had liked the characters more, or if the writing itself had been more compelling. The later is a matter of personal taste, but to me the craftsmanship was not equal to the story. Of the characters, the only ones I really cared for were the woman.

My guess is that Randolph's family still controls what is by all accounts a fabulous estate; thus both their own as well as Randolph's privacy interests will live on.

He took all of it very seriously and he would come in and fill us all on little known zombie facts. I thought I was going to die laughing.My 30-something brother picked it up and just had a great time with it. He said it was a fun and interesting read.

They would then market the end result as a 'live' (in quotes) recording, thus having the effect of a live recording, without the costs of putting on a concert. I suspect that this record is one such album. That aside, it has some brilliant songs, recalling the Soul Stirrers' golden era with Sam Cooke and R.H. Harris. I first had this on cassette tape in the 70's (which fell apart many years ago) and I search far and wide for it ever since. Now that I found it, nearly 30 years later, it sounds every bit as good as I remembered.

There was an air of humor in some of the scenes and the entire story just never lagged.In conclusion: surprisingly, I will read another of this author's books in hopes that he draws a character that I do not want killed.

I would recommend this CD only if you are a young student who wants to play the pieces with a metronome and along with the CD at the same time, as Fischer does not know the meaning of musical nuance.

One of the inspirations for his memoirs was Napoleon's subsequent denial of the importance of the partisans in this phase of the war. Unsurprisingly, then, the memoirs often seem argumentative, and present themselves as a mixture of personal experience, hearsay information, and analysis. The primary concern is with things that are worthy of being deemed \"history\" in the grand sense, and in order to make historical arguments, Davidov relies heavily on hearsay. Among his goals are (1) to document and to take credit for his own achievements as a leader of partisans; (2) to explain, to analyze and to critique strategic and tactical decisions of other leaders; (3) to explain important military events in terms of their less well-known causes; (4) to share his experience of famous military leaders (he gives a lengthy characterization of Suvorov, and decribes his observations of Napoleon).\n"}, {"label": "neutral", "sentence": "Title: Not what I was expecting..\nText: Being a fan of Ryan Scully's other ventures, I figured that Id like this album.

In the end you are so in touch with the story and its characters that you start to hope that the Germans will succeed in their crazy mission.The pace of the narrative is quite slow for the first hundred pages, but this gives the reader the opportunity to get really involved into the lives of the main characters.

One paragraph later he says that anything that one would have put in \"Hold/Review\" should actually go in \"Read/Review\"....with no substantive differentiation.2. The book is replete with instances where Allen creates a proper noun such as \"Someday/Maybe\" and then overlays it with another word \"Incubate\"...which sounds an awful lot like \"Hold (incubate?) and Review\".While I did not attempt to do so, my overwhelming impression is that a systematic reconsideration of the system and a rewriting of the book in which every component fits in a coherent way with the next, could turn this into a useful system.\n"}, {"label": "positive", "sentence": "Title: Great 'til the string breaks!\nText: This one definitely dries the lettuce the best of any I've tried.

This is sad, as I feel that this period was one of the most creative for the band. \"Add Some Music To Your Day\" is one of the group's best. I was always a fan of the Holland album and was happy to see that the \"The Trader\" and \"California Saga\" were included. The covers of \"Peggy Sue\", \"Come Go With Me\" and \"California Dreamin'\" are surprisely enjoyable.

It's most important feature is that you can clean and maintain it as often as you want without having to replace it.You simply cannot expect a high performance gain from a filter installed in the stock filter box, in a stock, low-rev engine. Yes, it sounds better at high rev and maybe adds a couple of HP, but that's not really noticeable in an engine with 160HP to boot with. Even a CAI would not benefit that engine that much - not without a proper ECU remap.

Finding a message about a man's undying love for his wife would get most women and their libidos racing to find \"man with love expressive language.\" You can ask most single women, and I guess married ones too, how often they hear a man express his love, passionately, to them or anyone else. The answer will probably not surprise you so, when a woman senses this in a man, even if he is expressing it for another woman, said woman will want it, at any cost. Sparks mixes his metaphors, and continued to ignore the verb-object agreement.

Ultimately, the story is tied together by a very abrupt and rushed ending. Just very unsatisfying.

I was hoping that Hawks Rest would give me insights into the \"real\" world of Yellowstone.Given these expectations, the book truly did satisfy my purposes and I was pleased. But it also turned into a political screed. Although I very much believe in Ferguson's cause of alerting the public to the abuses of the elite hunting culture in Yellowstone, I feel that he devoted too much of this book to this cause.

It is the most magical, moving and haunting piece written for small orchestra and vocalists. The redemption scene at the end in which a madwoman's madness is absolved is of such beauty and power it leaves you breathless.However, this recording does not show the piece to it's full potential. The performances while vocally strong, have brash, harsh and annoying \"old men belting\" sounds. Even the wonderful Peter Pearce is not at his best here, where his performance of the madwoman is just too sane and slightly cold and nasal. Occasionally, the diction is unclear too (perhaps due to the nature of the piece), and the band/orchestra lacks flow, fluidity and sensitivity.However, I would still urge any enthusiast in 20th Century opera to buy this!\n"}, {"label": "neutral", "sentence": "Title: Too repetitive spacesynth\nText: I really can't understand why Michiel and Erik didn't use a little bit more imagination when they were making this album.

Using the selective focus feature doesn't help as some part of the image will be always out of focus. The Coolscan may produce a 4000 dpi scan, but it will not be sharp center-to-edge unless the film is absolutely flat -rarely the case. This problem offsets any advantage of using high-quality optics on your camera.

It took me years of bumbling around to find the really good stuff on the earlier albums. As for this taken on its own terms, there ARE some good songs here, peppered with filler. I particularly liked \"Time Waits for No one\" and \"Till the Next Goodbye.\" Languid but good mid-tempo stuff. I also really enjoy \"Fingerprint File\", which at least sounded like they were trying something different.
